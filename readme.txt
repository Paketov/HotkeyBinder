~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hotkey Binder~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you press hot keys, it generates keystrokes of other keys. 
	I use it to increase/decrease the volume.

Installation and use:
	1. For install run as administrator  <your arch>\install.bat
	2. For config change <your arch>\HotkeyConfig.txt and run <your arch>\set_config.bat
	3. Reboot PC or logoff->login
	4. For uninstall run <your arch>\uninstall.bat

Have fun!
